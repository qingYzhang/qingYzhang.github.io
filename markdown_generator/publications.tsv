2024-10-31	BURExtract-Llama: An LLM for Clinical Concept Extraction in Breast Ultrasound Reports	MCHM'24: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Multimedia Computing for Health and Medicine, pp. 53–58	This paper introduces BURExtract-Llama, a fine-tuned Llama3-8B model for extracting clinical concepts from unstructured breast ultrasound reports. Leveraging GPT-4 to bootstrap a small annotated dataset, the authors demonstrate that their in-house model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, matching GPT-4’s performance while significantly reducing cost and enhancing privacy protections. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3688868.3689200
