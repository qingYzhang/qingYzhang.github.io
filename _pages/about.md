Welcome to my personal website!

I’m currently a First-Year Master's Student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). My research interests are multimodal models, large language models, and their applications in healthcare.

Currently, I am working on healthcare foundation models under the supervision of Prof. [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/). My specific job responsibility is to use data generalization techniques to improve the performance of downstream tasks for the model.

During my undergraduate years at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), I worked on automated radiology report generation from knee X-rays under the guidance of Prof. [Sumit Chopra](https://www.spchopra.net/) and Prof. [Yiqiu Shen](https://seyiqi.github.io/). This project integrated state-of-the-art vision-language models with clinical workflows to support diagnostic decision-making and medical education.

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work, projects, and research!
