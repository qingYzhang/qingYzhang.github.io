Welcome to my personal website!

Iâ€™m currently a senior at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. My research interests are multimodal models, large language models, and their applications in healthcare.

Currently, I am working on automated radiology report generation from knee X-rays under the guidance of Prof. [Sumit Chopra](https://www.spchopra.net/) and Prof. [Yiqiu Shen](https://seyiqi.github.io/). This project integrates state-of-the-art vision-language models with clinical workflows to support diagnostic decision-making and medical education.

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work, projects, and research!
